            With the keebio iris, no matter what I'm stuck with a TRRS cable between the two halves. I eventually plan on getting a different keyboard, but until then that's what I have.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current experiment is to use backpack webbing. My model of keyboard has M6 bolt sized tenting holes, which is decidedly not shaped like backpack webbing. So for now I use a carabiner hooked into that hole, and sew a strap that connects to a carabiner on one end, and a backpack clip on the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arguably, if I'm still going to deal with a TRRS cable regardless, I probably don't need a backpack clip, and in practice it's barely used. But these are things you only realize when you start writing them down, I guess.
