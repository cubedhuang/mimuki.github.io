            Here's everything that's changed and changing in my life lately.
            The idea is that if we haven't spoken in 6 months, this is the kind
            of stuff I wanna tell you about.

          <h1>Website shenanigans</h1>
          <p>
            Lipamanka got my brain into website hyperfocus mode, so I've gotten
            this website online and started yelling into the void on it. Ideally
            with only a few questionable typos, but I'm getting there.
          </p>

          <h1>Self improvement, but like, the cool kind</h1>
          <p>
            I've been more strict on my relationship with social media, and it's
            been an interesting challenge. I have my phone set up so that all
            my go-to chat apps redirect me to my notes, and I instead microblog
            to the void about what's on my mind. It's interesting, and actually
            pretty fun. I'm still social media-ing on my PC as normal, but the
            idea is to make it more of a "destination" than it normally is. If
            you've been wondering why I've been less "around", that's
            potentially why.

          <h1>Still knitting, as always</h1>
          <p>
              I got into knitting last year, and I've made some neat stuff like
              some hoods and a scarf. I wrote about said scarf in toki pona taso
              but I forgot to save that (or ever use that website again, oops),
              so it's lost to the internet now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm working on a seasonally inappropriate beanie, though
            I need to buy more DPNs before I can finish it. I'm tempted to make
            a temperature blanket for 2023, but with how much yarn that takes
            it's looking like a 2024 project.

          <h1>Dwarf Fortress</h1>
          <p>
            Steam DF came out at last, but it's impossible to play with keynav
            or keynavish. After a lot of research I've just settled on learning
            classic DF, but that's been both very confusing and very rewarding
            and fun.
